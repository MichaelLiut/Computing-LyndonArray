# Data Generation Files
-----
Herein you will find the data generation files for _binary_, _dna_, _english_, 
and _integer_ strings. Further, I have included the generation files of 
_EXTREME_ strings, which generate data for _IDLA_ and _TRLA_ strings. 

If you would like access to the original data generated please contact me and 
it can be made avaiable on request.
